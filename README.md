# DudDuRu

DudDuRu is a simple program that can help you find the duplicate files.  
For more information, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/smilecatx3/DudDuRu/wiki) page.
You can download the pre-built executable on the [releases](https://github.com/smilecatx3/DudDuRu/releases) page.  
  
Note that this is still the beta version, DO NOT use this program on important data.  
Always confirm the files marked with strikeout before moving them to recycle bin.
